# MuseGAN

We investigated using MuseGAN to create polyphonic piano music, trained with a dataset of MIDI files from Classical Archive.

We created tools for preparing datasets for MuseGAN, and for merging datasets to the single-file NPZ format used by MuseGAN v3.

We used a simplified MuseGAN network to create _de novo_ songs.

We used MuseGAN v3 to create accompaniment tracks for either piano left or right hand.
